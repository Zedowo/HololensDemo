# HololensDemo

Project used to demonstrate the various MRTK and Hololens 2 features in a walk-through tutorial. Specifically, different scenes give guides on the different scripts (such as Object Manipulator), constraints, voice activation features, and general Hololens 2 interactions (such as eye tracking). 

The different scenes have corrosponding documentation that relate to how to manipulate variables, use certain attributes, and the general understanding of how these scripts and objects work. Refer to the PTHS Hololens 2 Page for more information.
